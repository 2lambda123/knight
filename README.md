# Path To Glory

**Path To Glory** is my entry for 2023's [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/) competition.

The game is a beat 'em up where you fight waves of enemies until you reach the final boss.

## Story

> 1254 AD
>
> The Kingdom of Syldavia is being invaded by the Northern Empire.
>
> The Syldavian army is outnumbered and outmatched.
>
> One lone soldier decides to take on the emperor himself.

## Build

```sh
make install
make
```

# License

Feel free to read the code but don't use it for commercial purposes. The game is the result of a lot of hard work and I wish to maintain all rights to it.
