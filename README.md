**Path To Glory** is my entry for 2023's [JS13K](https://js13kgames.com/) competition.

The game is a beat 'em up where you fight waves of enemies until you reach the final boss.

## Build

```sh
make install
make
```

## Debugging

When opening `debug.html`:
- <kbd>F</kbd> to speed up time
- <kbd>G</kbd> to slow down time
- `level = new TestLevel()` to use test level
- `level = new GameplayLevel()` to skip tutorial
- `level = new GameplayLevel(99)` to go straight to final boss

# License

Feel free to read the code but don't use it for commercial purposes. The game is the result of a lot of hard work and I wish to maintain all rights to it.

Please reach out if you wish to distribute the game on your portal.
